Video Quality Assessment (VQA) is an emerging area of research which aims at establishing objective quality evaluation methodologies for predicting video quality. Objective quality assessment algorithms have several applications like real-time monitoring of quality in networks, improve quality of experience (QoE) for users, evaluating compression algorithms etc. In this project only No Reference approach was considered where reference video or pristine video is not available during evaluation phase. Employing statistics of optical flow estimates to predict video quality was analyzed. 

This project was undertaken as part of Digital Video: Perception and Algorithms(E9 206) course during August-December 2017. Further details about the project and results are available {{% staticref "pdf/DV_Report.pdf" "newtab" %}}here{{% /staticref %}}.
