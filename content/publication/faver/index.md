abstract: 'Video quality assessment (VQA) remains an important and challenging problem
  that affects many applications at the widest scales. Recent advances in mobile devices
  and cloud computing techniques have made it possible to capture, process, and share
  high resolution, high frame rate (HFR) videos across the Internet nearly instantaneously.
  Being able to monitor and control the quality of these streamed videos can enable
  the delivery of more enjoyable content and perceptually optimized rate control.
  Accordingly, there is a pressing need to develop VQA models that can be deployed
  at enormous scales. While some recent effects have been applied to full-reference
  (FR) analysis of variable frame rate and HFR video quality, the development of no-reference
  (NR) VQA algorithms targeting frame rate variations has been little studied. Here,
  we propose a first-of-a-kind blind VQA model for evaluating HFR videos, which we
  dub the Framerate-Aware Video Evaluator w/o Reference (FAVER). FAVER uses extended
  models of spatial natural scene statistics that encompass spaceâ€“time wavelet-decomposed
  video signals, and leverages the advantages of the deep neural network to provide
  motion perception, to conduct efficient frame rate sensitive quality prediction.
  Our extensive experiments on several HFR video quality datasets show that FAVER
  outperforms other blind VQA algorithms at a reasonable computational cost. To facilitate
  reproducible research and public evaluation, an implementation of FAVER is being
  made freely available online: https://github.com/uniqzheng/HFR-BVQA.'
