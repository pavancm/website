abstract: High frame rate videos are increasingly getting popular in recent years,
  driven by the strong requirements of the entertainment and streaming industries
  to provide high quality of experiences to consumers. To achieve the best trade-offs
  between the bandwidth requirements and video quality in terms of frame rate adaptation,
  it is imperative to understand the effects of frame rate on video quality. In this
  direction, we devise a novel statistical entropic differencing method based on a
  Generalized Gaussian Distribution model expressed in the spatial and temporal band-pass
  domains, which measures the difference in quality between reference and distorted
  videos. The proposed design is highly generalizable and can be employed when the
  reference and distorted sequences have different frame rates. Our proposed model
  correlates very well with subjective scores in the recently proposed LIVE-YT-HFR
  database and achieves state of the art performance when compared with existing methodologies.
