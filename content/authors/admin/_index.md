I am a researcher at Intelligent Imaging group at [Samsung Research America](https://research.samsung.com/sra). My research interests are primarily in the overlapping areas of image/video processing, computer vision and computational photography. I also interested in applying self-supervision and generative modeling techniques to various imaging applications. Previously, I did my PhD in the beautiful city of Austin, TX, at [UT Austin](http://www.utexas.edu/) under the 'great' [Dr. Alan Bovik's](http://utw10503.utweb.utexas.edu/bovik.php) supervision!

You can find my resume [here](uploads/pdf/Pavan_CV.pdf).
